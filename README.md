## Recognizing Italian Sign Gestures with Bidirectional\\Neural Networks

During a project at ETH ZÃ¼rich, we have implemented a neural network in TensorFlow which recognizes Italian sign gestures from short video clips. Using a bidirectional neural network architecture we were able to beat the *hard*-baseline with our model, reaching a correct classification rate of 82.8% on test data. This is joint work with Stephan Artmann.

This repository contains a detailed report of our model architecture, regularization techniques and findings.
